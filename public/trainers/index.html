<p><strong>Remembering MONICA ECHEVERRI CASAREZ</strong>
Our beloved trainer Monica Echeverri Casarez passed away Easter Sunday due to complications caused by Covid-19. Monica taught our Southwest Detroit cohorts and her entrepreneurs loved her for many reasons. We remember Monica as a bright energetic personality with a sharp mind. She was a woman who valued justice and took action to help others. She had a way to entertain and inspire and we loved hearing her stories and insights.  A true community leader, Monica worked tirelessly to help those in need and we wish to honor her memory by ensuring that her work continues. We are mourning her loss, uplifting her beautiful spirit, and praying for her family and loved ones.</p>
<p>For more on Monica see our <a href="http://localhost:1313/2020/04/24/monica/">remembrance post.</a></p>
