<p>ProsperUS Detroit is only possible due to the generous support of the philanthropic community, including philanthropy and private companies. This support allows us to meet our mission of providing <strong>equitable, culturally appropriate</strong> programming to Detroit residents and in its neighborhoods. Philanthropy has also challenged us to develop a robust program evaluation that has allowed to us to: assess who is being served, what their barriers to access are, and to hear their ideas about solutions and innovations to removing those barriers.</p>

</a>In addition to supporting the overall operations of our program, <a href="https://cfsem.org/initiative/new-economy-initiative/">NEI</a> has made it possible to conduct necessary research and data collection needed to address challenges at the systemic level - namely with the creation of a Neighborhood Commercial Market Analysis. We are also appreciative of the NEI Worktable, that serves as a convening for thought leaders in the entrepreneurial space.</p>

The <a href="http://www.wkkf.org/">W.K. Kellogg Foundation</a> was our first funder and helped to shape our approach to include family and economic security as well as racial equity. In addition to supporting overall operations, their funding has allowed us to create a micro-lending infrastructure that is truly unique in the market. Inasmuch, we have been able to integrate financial literacy, professional services, and workforce development into the lending services programming.</p>

<p>This work is exhaustive and requires authentic, long-term relationships in order to disrupt cycles of poverty and disenfranchisement. All aspects of our program are eager to work with funders and foundations that seek ways to connect with Detroit’s neighborhood businesses and promote place-based economic development. If your organization is interested in working with low and moderate income, immigrant and minority entrepreneurs and small business owners, we welcome your enthusiasm to help grow our program and offer essential resources to the community.</p>
