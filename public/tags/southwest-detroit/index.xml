      <description>ProsperUS Detroit will be in your neighborhood soon! Two ProsperUS Detroit, staff members, Chris Butterfield, Small Business Advisor, and Amanda Brewington, Loan Officer, will be holding open office hours in our five geographies. The purpose of these office hours is to get us into the areas we serve and answer questions, start conversations and make access to our services even easier.
