      For many ProsperUS Detroit Grads and participants, being an entrepreneur is as much about what you are all building for yourselves as it is about what you&rsquo;re building for your families and communities in the future. An issue this brings up is: how do entrepreneurs balance having a family and building a business? This issue is magnified when school is out for the summer and the issues of extended childcare become even more urgent.

      When Kecia Escoe applied to ProsperUs Detroit, she had recently left a human resources management position with her long-time employer, Ticketmaster. It was while completing her thesis for a master&rsquo;s human resources program, when an emotional life event led to her discovery of her genetic talent for quilting. Although Kecia was pursuing human resources consulting, she chose to also pursue the ProsperUS Detroit Entrepreneur Training Program at Focus: HOPE with trainer, Herb Drayton.

      Meet Katrina Taylor-Harris, someone we like to call a “Superstar.” In just over a year, she’s completed her Master in Social Work, completed the ProsperUS Detroit entrepreneur training class, secured a building for her daycare program, and closed on a micro-loan with ProsperUs. Her journey, to owning and operating First Step Children and Family Center, has been rare and unbelievably swift. It seems like just yesterday that our team was interviewing Katrina for a spot in one of the Focus: HOPE training cohorts.

Appropriately named, Sweet Thoughts is a dessert business selling various forms of delicious chocolate and dessert chips, additionally offering healthy yet sweet options that still manage to be delicious.

After lots of careful research on the topic, including testing groups, Parham started her business, Lucky Pistil, in 2016. Lucky Pistil is a far cry from traditional cannabis edibles found in dispensaries. Parham’s dishes and catering services are gourmet dishes with up-scale food and service, though she does offer the option of casual settings as well.

      People of ProsperUS: Enid Parham By: Torisa Johnson A chef all of her life, Detroit native Enid Parham puts a twist on food by combining her passion for cooking with her love for cannabis. After lots of careful research on the topic, including testing groups, Parham started her business, Lucky Pistil, in 2016. Lucky Pistil is a far cry from traditional cannabis edibles found in dispensaries. Parham’s dishes and catering services are gourmet dishes with up-scale food and service, though she does offer the option of casual settings as well.

      For many ProsperUS Detroit Grads and participants, being an entrepreneur is as much about what you are all building for yourselves as it is about what you&rsquo;re building for your families and communities in the future. An issue this brings up is: how do entrepreneurs balance having a family and building a business? This issue is magnified when school is out for the summer and the issues of extended childcare become even more urgent.

Growing up in a large family with nine siblings, Walker spent lots of quality time early in life experimenting with deserts and competing against her siblings. Walker’s fond memories of making cow patties alongside them influenced the name of her business, Sweet Thoughts. Appropriately named, Sweet Thoughts is a dessert business selling various forms of delicious chocolate and dessert chips, additionally offering healthy yet sweet options that still manage to be delicious.

      People of ProsperUS: Enid Parham By: Torisa Johnson A chef all of her life, Detroit native Enid Parham puts a twist on food by combining her passion for cooking with her love for cannabis. After lots of careful research on the topic, including testing groups, Parham started her business, Lucky Pistil, in 2016. Lucky Pistil is a far cry from traditional cannabis edibles found in dispensaries. Parham’s dishes and catering services are gourmet dishes with up-scale food and service, though she does offer the option of casual settings as well.

      For many ProsperUS Detroit Grads and participants, being an entrepreneur is as much about what you are all building for yourselves as it is about what you&rsquo;re building for your families and communities in the future. An issue this brings up is: how do entrepreneurs balance having a family and building a business? This issue is magnified when school is out for the summer and the issues of extended childcare become even more urgent.

      Meet Katrina Taylor-Harris, someone we like to call a “Superstar.” In just over a year, she’s completed her Master in Social Work, completed the ProsperUS Detroit entrepreneur training class, secured a building for her daycare program, and closed on a micro-loan with ProsperUs. Her journey, to owning and operating First Step Children and Family Center, has been rare and unbelievably swift. It seems like just yesterday that our team was interviewing Katrina for a spot in one of the Focus: HOPE training cohorts.

      Chanell Scott Contreras is the new director of Southwest Solutions’ ProsperUS Detroit program. Chanell takes over the role held by Kimberly Faison, who left to become program officer at the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation. Kimberly had led ProsperUS since it began in 2012, and developed it into a premier program to train and support ethnic and immigrant entrepreneurs wanting to establish small businesses in Detroit neighborhoods.
“I am inspired by ProsperUS’ place-based approach to equitable economic development, and am honored and thrilled to join the ProsperUS team of talented and dedicated individuals who have an incredible track record of assisting aspiring small business owners in the city,” said Chanell.

      When Kecia Escoe applied to ProsperUs Detroit, she had recently left a human resources management position with her long-time employer, Ticketmaster.

Although Kecia was pursuing human resources consulting, she chose to also pursue the ProsperUS Detroit Entrepreneur Training Program at Focus: HOPE with trainer, Herb Drayton.

Her journey, to owning and operating First Step Children and Family Center, has been rare and unbelievably swift. It seems like just yesterday that our team was interviewing Katrina for a spot in one of the Focus: HOPE training cohorts.

      For many ProsperUS Detroit Grads and participants, being an entrepreneur is as much about what you are all building for yourselves as it is about what you&rsquo;re building for your families and communities in the future. An issue this brings up is: how do entrepreneurs balance having a family and building a business?

      For many ProsperUS Detroit Grads and participants, being an entrepreneur is as much about what you are all building for yourselves as it is about what you&rsquo;re building for your families and communities in the future. An issue this brings up is: how do entrepreneurs balance having a family and building a business? This issue is magnified when school is out for the summer and the issues of extended childcare become even more urgent.
