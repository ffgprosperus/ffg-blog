      <description>Growing our neighborhoods and our communities takes all of us! Join ProsperUS Detroit in supporting local entrepreneurs this holiday season. In this list, you will find events hosted by community partners and neighborhood groups supporting ProsperUS Grads. If you have an event you&amp;rsquo;d like to add to our list, please let us know! We hope you&amp;rsquo;ll support your neighbors with your shopping this season (and all year!).
Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to share the excitement with #ShopSmallDetroit!</description>
