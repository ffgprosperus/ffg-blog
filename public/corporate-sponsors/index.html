<p><strong>MONEY</strong>
No matter what your company’s philanthropic budget is, you can make a difference. Below are the sponsorship levels:</p>
<p>$1,000 - Buy dinner for each of the training sessions</p>
<p><em>Our aspiring business owners come to the sessions after busy days with their jobs and families. While ProsperUS cannot provide the participants with food for 11 sessions, adding dinner would go a long way in improving participant morale.</em></p>
<p>$5,000 – Help with marketing the program to communities</p>
<p><em>Many aspiring small business owners do not know about the opportunity ProsperUS presents to them. With your contribution, we can run a proper marketing campaign, which will reach more people and change more lives.</em></p>
<p>$10,000 – Sponsor a cohort for 11-week training</p>
<p><em>An 11-week training course costs $10,000. Your sponsorship will help transform individuals with aspirations but little wherewithal, into people with the skills and tools needed to implement their business vision.</em></p>
<p>$25,000 – Sponsor a participant’s small business loan</p>
<p><em>An individual who graduates our program qualifies for $25,000 in loans towards the startup costs of a new business. Your company can handpick a participant, and track their business’s progress. Your contribution will be given to ProsperUS, which will then supply the individual with the loan.</em></p>
<p><strong>IN-KIND DONATIONS</strong></p>
<p>As the participants start their business, they have the need for stationary, computers, phones, office furniture, and the like. ProsperUS will store your donation, notify all participants and distribute the supplies.</p>
<p><strong>TIME</strong>
If your company prefers a more hands-on connection to your nonprofit partners, we offer a range of ways you can donate your time and expertise:</p>
<p>Tier 1: Guest Lecture
<em>Donate your company’s employees for guest lectures during the training course. The topics would range from Internet Marketing to Operations Management.</em>
Time Commitment: 4 Hours</p>
<p>Tier 2: Help ProsperUS Increase its Capacity
<em>ProsperUS is always looking to expand and improve. To that end, we are searching for professional help in program evaluation and analysis. In helping ProsperUS, your company ensures that people in underserved areas of Detroit continue to get trained in starting their own businesses.</em>
Time Commitment: 10 Hours</p>
<p>Tier 3: Provide Professional Services
<em>Provide professional services in legal advice, marketing, finance, operations, and workforce development to participants who have graduated from the training program.</em>
Time Commitment: 14 Hours (no more than 2 hours a week)</p>
<p>Tier 4: Support and Mentor a New Business Owner
<em>As ProsperUS participants start implementing their business plans they will need guidance and support from an experienced professional. Your company can lend an ear to these new business owners and give them some general guidance about their business’s direction.</em>
Time Commitment: 1 hour meetings every two weeks for 1 year (26 hours)</p>
<h2 id="how-to-join-us">How to Join US</h2>
