      People of ProsperUS: Olivia Croom By: Anna Gotskind “I am a dentist by training and had my own practice for a number of years. I sold it and started working for a large dental organization that treated the underserved population.
When Olivia Croom, one of the co-founders of Dancing Zebras, began treating children from low-income families she quickly discovered that many of them had substantial tooth decay.
Inspired, Croom went home and decided she would find a way to address this problem herself.
