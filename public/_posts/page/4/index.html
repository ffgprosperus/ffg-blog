We’re a casual fine dining Caribbean restaurant in the Jefferson-Chalmers neighborhood. The area is historic. The building is historic. From what I was told I am the first sit-down restaurant in the area in 30 years. The construction on the building started in 2017, and then, in late 2018 the build-out was finished and we opened our doors to the public.

“I’m from Yemen originally, and moved to Michigan in 1999 with my parents. I grew up in Hamtramck and went to school there. After graduating High School, I did two semesters of college at Henry Ford, and then I dropped out. It was boring for me, but I should have stayed to finish my degree. I then went into trucking.
