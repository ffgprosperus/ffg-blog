      Flagstar Grant Winners
Many congratulations to the Flagstar Bank Grant winners! We are happy to know that you are among the 18 small businesses owned by people of color that will receive the $5,000 grant. We hope this brings you relief and some peace to this holiday season. While we are proud to be working to support small businesses, now more than ever, we also recognize that this is part of a much bigger problem.

      People of ProsperUS: Lesa Walker By: Torisa Johnson  Lesa Walker grew up in Canada, and has lived in Detroit for her adult life. Growing up in a large family with nine siblings, Walker spent lots of quality time early in life experimenting with deserts and competing against her siblings. Walker’s fond memories of making cow patties alongside them influenced the name of her business, Sweet Thoughts. Appropriately named, Sweet Thoughts is a dessert business selling various forms of delicious chocolate and dessert chips, additionally offering healthy yet sweet options that still manage to be delicious.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      People of ProsperUS: Enid Parham By: Torisa Johnson A chef all of her life, Detroit native Enid Parham puts a twist on food by combining her passion for cooking with her love for cannabis. After lots of careful research on the topic, including testing groups, Parham started her business, Lucky Pistil, in 2016. Lucky Pistil is a far cry from traditional cannabis edibles found in dispensaries. Parham’s dishes and catering services are gourmet dishes with up-scale food and service, though she does offer the option of casual settings as well.

After Addington began to notice the positive changes as a result of her vegan diet, she decided to share this with her community.

      People of ProsperUS: Mayra Planas By: Torisa Johnson Mayra Planas moved from Miami to Detroit with her family in 2002. Born and raised in Cuba, Miami resembled home in language and climate, but Detroit was a completely different scene. Planas tried to go back to Miami for two years, but in the end was glad she stayed, as she developed a love for both the city and the people. The idea to start her company, Havana on Wheels, came to Planas in 2014.
