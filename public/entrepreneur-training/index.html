<p>The ProsperUS Detroit Entrepreneur Training program utilizes a place-based focus to economic development. In collaboration with <a href="http://localhost:1313/community-partners/">Community Partners</a> in specific areas in the city seen as having barriers to economic development and stability, we offer a comprehensive, 15-week entrepreneur training program that helps participants realize their potential, develop a business plan, and get their business off the ground. Through this program, we look to our entrepreneurs to be examples, leaders, and potentially employers, in these communities as business owners.</p>
<p>This course offers participants an overview of fundamental business principals as well as dedicated one-on-one support. By graduation participants should understand their business model, market, and finances. We expect and support participants as they legally register their business, create budgets and systems of bookkeeping, and write a business plan.</p>
<p>The program consists of:</p>
<pre><code>  * 6 different training sites across the city of Detroit (all classes will be held virtually)
  * 10-12 participants in each virtual class
  * 12 two-hour virtual sessions (once per week, usually from 6 to 8 pm on a weeknight)
  * 10 one-hour one-on-one consultations (scheduled separately with trainer)
  * 15 week duration from first class to graduation
</code></pre>
<h2 id="who-we-serve">Who We Serve</h2>
<p>Our Entrepreneur Training participants are Detroit residents who plan to, or currently, have a business in our target geographies in the city. We accommodate all ages and stages of entrepreneurs, and if we find that our program will not serve you best, we are able to make recommendations for other supports in the community. Working directly with Community Partners, we strive to help participants find a network that works with them to achieve their dreams.</p>
<p>Participants accepted into the course are expected to pay $75 - total. We thank our funders who help offset the true cost of $800 and allow us to ensure the program is accessible to those with the most to gain.</p>
<p>Applicants will be assigned to sites based on geography. We only accept applicants who live in Detroit, Hamtramck, or Highland Park. Although we prioritize operational businesses, we may also accept experienced and focused applicants.</p>

<p><strong>If I don’t get in, what do I do?</strong> We always have more applicants for the program than we can accept each season.

There are numerous options available throughout the city for different stages of business development, and we will make a referral to the ones that may be better for you.</p>

<p>**Is there a cost for the training? **Each participant pays a fee of $75.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I take the class?</strong> The classes are offered in all of our target economic development areas at our <a href="http://localhost:1313/community-partners/">Community Partner</a> locations: Cody-Rouge / Warrendale, Southwest Detroit, Lower East Side, Central Woodward-North End, and Grandmont Rosedale. </p>
