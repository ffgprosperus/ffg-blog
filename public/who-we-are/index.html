<p>ProsperUS Detroit is a place-based economic development strategy designed to empower low and moderate income, immigrant and minority individuals. Through our culturally competent range of services, we strive to support the entrepreneurial spirit and small business community that exists in Detroit’s neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>ENTREPRENEUR TRAINING</strong>
Our training is about more than creating a business plan, it is about the introduction of solid business planning principles, network building, forming ideas and concepts, all combined with personal and professional development. The classroom environment is intended to provide a safe, accessible learning space that facilitates authentic dialogue about entrepreneurship and community leadership.</p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS SERVICES</strong>
Business services include a range of personal and professional development tools that help in moving the entrepreneur and their business from one stage to the next within the business marketplace. The services are delivered through a host of professional providers across numerous business sectors, including accounting, legal, graphic design, and others.</p>
<p><strong>MICRO-LENDING</strong>
Our micro-lending model is unlike any other traditional micro-lending program. We seek out the strengths of the entrepreneur, such as their character and the benefit of their business to the community, in order to offset the standard methods of evaluating financial risk. Our staff assists entrepreneurs in the lending process by providing access to financial coaching, workforce development, and other business services while leveraging our relationships with dozens of agencies within our network to support their micro-lending engagement.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Our training program model was developed over twenty years ago by a Minneapolis, Minnesota organization, <a href="http://www.ndc-mn.org/">Neighborhood Development Center</a>. A local organization, <a href="http://www.globaldetroit.com/">Global Detroit</a>, helped Southwest Economic Solutions launch ProsperUS Detroit and begin the process of assisting low-income, minority and immigrant residents of the city gain access to economic development resources through entrepreneurship training and business support services. In October of 2020 ProsperUS transitioned to be entirely independent from Southwest Solutions.</p>
<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is to provide opportunities for individuals and families to achieve greater economic success. The team at ProsperUS Detroit believes that residents, small businesses, and neighborhood groups in all communities have the talent, energy, and ability to engage and revitalize their own communities. It is our mission to empower entrepreneurs and our Community Partners to transform low-income neighborhood economies from within.</p>
<h2 id="values">Values</h2>
<p><strong>PARTNERSHIP</strong>
Partnerships with community-based organizations allow us to earn the trust of local residents.</p>
<p><strong>POWER OF CULTURE</strong>
Highly accessible, culturally competent services eliminate barriers to success.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP</strong>
Working at scale creates social capital and physical assets that communities own.</p>
<p><strong>FLEXIBILITY</strong>
A comprehensive, flexible, long-term approach helps entrepreneurs succeed in a constantly changing environment.</p>
<p><strong>INNOVATION</strong>
Improvement and innovation fueled by regular evaluation, lead to our sustained effectiveness.</p>
