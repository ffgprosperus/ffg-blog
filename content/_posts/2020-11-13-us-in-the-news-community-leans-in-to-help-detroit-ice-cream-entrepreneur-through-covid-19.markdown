# US in the News: "Community Leans in to Help Detroit Ice Cream Entrepreneur Through COVID-19"

We are always happy to share the achievements of ProsperUS entrepreneurs. Congratulations to KaToya Scott, owner of [Junk Food and Friends](https://www.junkfoodandfriends.com), who was recently featured in model D media!


<blockquote>_Ice cream may not fix the problems Detroit residents face, but KaToya Scott will tell you it certainly helps. From the window of her mobile ice cream truck throughout the summer, the entrepreneur has witnessed the power of sharing a taste of normality in times of social, political, and public health-related upheaval._</blockquote>
