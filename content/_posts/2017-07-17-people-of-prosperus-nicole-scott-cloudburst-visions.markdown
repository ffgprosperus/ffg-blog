This is the third post in “People of ProsperUS,” showcasing the incredible stories of entrepreneurs connected to ProsperUS. 

This post features [Nicole Scott](https://www.facebook.com/nicole.scott.1804109), the owner of Cloudburst Visions Consulting.

“I have a social media marketing agency and my niche is restaurants and bars. I’m still in the early startup stages but I do a lot of prospecting. It is a lot of work, I’m usually reaching out to actual bars trying to get in touch [by contacting] decision makers: the business owner or general manager. I usually leave my business card and then follow up. I also offer a free social media audit of their social media accounts. I take a couple of accounts, analyze them, and send them a report.”


## ON STARTING A BUSINESS


“I initially started working in social media in 2012. I apprenticed with a woman who was a love coach and she started out on Facebook and bartered services. She was looking for someone to help her and I volunteered to be a part of a program. That experience sparked my interest in social media and I’ve been managing my own social media accounts since. In January of this year I enrolled in a Tai Lopez social media and marketing agency program and decided to take the existing business I had, which was a nonprofit consulting business, and transitioning it into focusing on social media instead. I lost my job in 2014, and at that point I didn’t want an employer to determine my destiny, so I started looking into entrepreneurship. Being a small business owner means I control my day-to-day activities. The type of life I want is what I make of it. It is hard work and a lot of hours, but I don’t mind because I enjoy what I’m doing. I have a son who is 14 years old and he will be out of school in 4 years, so my goal is to have a laptop lifestyle. I’d like to be able to travel and work where I am and set up my business so that I could do that.”


## ON PROSPERUS DETROIT


“I have a fully completed business plan and am working with ProsperUS to tweak it and am using legal technical assistance; I am currently working with a law firm to help me with contracts. I’m looking for web development and would like someone to work with me on my website [as well].”


## ON ADVICE FOR ENTREPRENEURS


“If it’s something you’re really passionate about then you should really work towards it. Don’t be afraid to ask for assistance. Age doesn’t matter.”
