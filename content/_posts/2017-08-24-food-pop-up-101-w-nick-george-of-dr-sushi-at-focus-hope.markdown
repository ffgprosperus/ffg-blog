ProsperUS Detroit's new workshop series, a collaboration with Nick George of [Dr. Sushi](http://www.doctorsushidetroit.com/)/[Detroit Pop-Up Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/detroitpopupalliance/), is a five session course, where serious food entrepreneurs are encouraged to develop their presentation, marketing, planning, and hospitality with an experienced chef and event planner. Participants will also be working alongside other intensely talented and passionate business owners in a spirit of learning and collaboration. The workshop series will take place at [Focus: HOPE](http://www.focushope.edu/) at 1400 Oakman Blvd, Detroit, MI.

Pop-up restaurants are an increasing trend nationwide, offering aspiring chefs the chance to test the market and prove concept. In our own backyard of Detroit, pop-ups have taken flight with a growing number gaining local and national attention. At the end of this workshop series, each participant will have the opportunity to schedule their own pop-up event with the guidance of Nick George. **Is your food business ready for that next step?**

_Cost for the five session workshop series is $100, made by money order to ProsperUS Detroit._

Since there is only room for 12 participants, we must select each candidate with careful consideration based on application responses and business readiness.
