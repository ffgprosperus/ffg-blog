“[My business is] Lush Yummies Pie Co. I sell pie; my signature pie is my Lemon “Butta” pie.”






## ON STARTING A BUSINESS




“I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit, I think. My grandmother started the first minority-owned business school in Detroit in 1973; it still stands today. She was the first female president of Booker T. Washington. She groomed me to do everything for myself. She always taught me about not taking handouts [and] pulling yourself up from your boot straps. I always knew I wanted to have my own business since I was a little girl. [Having a small business] means a lot to me. It means freedom; it means you get to do what you want. It means that your business is as big as you make it. You could be a small or a big business. I’m small now because I haven’t grown to where I know I can grow to, but I’m not going to be a small business forever.”




## ON PROSPERUS




“ProsperUS has helped me in a lot of different ways: from business training to helping me with financial advising. They helped me get a business coach; he’s been very instrumental in a lot of things I’ve done.The most helpful [resource] has been the business coach because I feel like he is the fountain of knowledge. I go to him for any questions I have. In business, a lot of times you will have questions you don’t know the answer to, but the coach does have the answer. Providing access to that person is a great help for me. ProsperUS has helped me by also giving me access to business services that they offer; I think that’s really important to take advantage of. [In] programs like ProsperUS, you qualify for business services [like] getting an attorney, branding, and social media help. I’ve used most of these.”




## ON ADVICE FOR ENTREPRENEURS






“Try to find as many resources as possible-- programs like ProsperUS, so that you don’t have to make as many mistakes. In business, you’re going to make a lot of mistakes that you can’t avoid, but to not have to experience as many of those mistakes will be a great help. Try to get help, talk to people, and use resources so that you don’t fall into those same pitfalls.”You can visit the Lush Yummies Pie Co.
