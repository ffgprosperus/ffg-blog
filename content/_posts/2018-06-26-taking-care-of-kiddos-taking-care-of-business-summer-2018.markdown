For many ProsperUS Detroit Grads and participants, being an entrepreneur is as much about what you are all building for yourselves as it is about what you're building for your families and communities in the future. An issue this brings up is: how do entrepreneurs balance having a family and building a business? This issue is magnified when school is out for the summer and the issues of extended childcare become even more urgent.

As a program supporting entrepreneurs, we want to recognize that this is absolutely a struggle for many entrepreneurs and want to offer the support of providing a list of some summer childcare resources in Detroit. This list is not exhaustive, but we're hoping to start the conversation so that other ProsperUS Grads and participants who are parents and caregivers can share their resources and ideas.

*ProsperUS Detroit does not endorse one particular program or opportunity. Please be vigilant it what works for your family / business / community.

At several Detroit schools, the City of Detroit and the Detroit Public Schools Community District have partnered to provide care to children at [Detroit Summer Fun Centers](http://detroitmi.gov/recreation). **All of the sites are at capacity**, but some locations may accept names for waitlists. This is a great option to keep in mind for next year:
