## June 19, 2020 Update on COVID-19


As the state begins to allow businesses to reopen we urge you to make responsible decisions about what is in the best interest of your community and you personally. If your business is reopening the State of Michigan requires that you update your COVID-19 Preparedness & Response Plan.

Next Tuesday there is a hands on workshop on creating this plan available here: [LINK](https://www.facebook.com/events/579783929202210/)

And a template for the Preparedness & Response Plan is available here: [LINK](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FMIOSHAplan%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0pawngksqQKtm6uIJUtgASAAQjHvVv_RrOA3fat0u9Dj21ZCH-ydafvTE&h=AT2SnCVduVhqzSVWO7Ua1mDhHDFrsJ8096mKHVlpYT5H9vr50JyK9MlUs67Fbe1QAQoM4fPsx-QqR055RJ880nqduqUEG6LT7Iz9vVzjASBy0otpzu9N0zWde2JGwg5dL-0rwIZuYpCML_zpflAe)

Dear ProsperUS Community:

Like many organizations, ProsperUS is carefully monitoring the COVID-19 issue and making plans to do our part to keep our community as safe and healthy as possible. We write you today to provide updates on how we are utilizing the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) [Community Mitigation Strategies](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.michigan.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F0%2C9753%2C7-406-98178_98155-521467--%2C00.html&data=02%7C01%7Cakaplowitz%40swsol.org%7Cfb5ce307a5eb4bdec20208d7c78dd1d7%7Cecdd61640dbd4227b0986de8e52525ca%7C0%7C0%7C637197285372747838&sdata=JqOWZ6sbvVMm3%2B3Ed47c2EiiUhMpMZoJZ6pFI%2BoVx50%3D&reserved=0) to adjust our programming and events:

Our **Annual Convening & Pitch Competition**, which was to take place on the evening of April 30, 2020 will be postponed until further notice. We intend to reschedule the event for a time when we can be certain of the safety of the 400 attendees we expect.  We will be in touch as soon as possible about a new date. All applications for the showcase and pitch competition will be considered for the new date, with no need to re-apply. We will reach out to applicants with more information as soon as possible.

Our **Spring 2020 Entrepreneurship Training Program** classes are currently being scheduled, with start dates potentially in late April, 2020. These classes include up to 12 participants, and therefore pose far less of a risk to participants. We will work with our trainers and community partners to ensure that all protocols for small group meetings are being followed at our training sites. Furthermore, we will continue to monitor MDHHS' recommendations and will adjust our timeline for Spring 2020 classes if needed.

Our **Business Services and Microlending** programs will continue as normal, with meetings taking place over the phone when possible.

Thank you for your understanding. We encourage everyone to take the necessary precautions for the safety of our community, especially our most vulnerable community members.

With care and in solidarity,
Chanell Scott Contreras, Director
& the ProsperUS Detroit Team</blockquote>
