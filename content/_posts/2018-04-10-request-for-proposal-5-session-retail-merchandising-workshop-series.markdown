In addition to ten (10) hours logged during the total class time, each of the maximum 12 participants will be granted two (2) 1-on-1 hours w the instructor throughout the cohort to work out their individual growth plans.

Total instructor compensation will range from $1,500 - $1,900 based on class size.
