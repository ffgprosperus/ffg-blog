![Business Service Providers - ProsperUS Detroit](http://www.prosperusdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Service-Providers.png)


Our Business Services program includes professional, trainer, and ProsperUS Detroit staff assistance in the areas of Accounting, Commercial Real Estate, Graphic Design, Human Resources, Legal, Marketing, Website Development, and others where appropriate. Once the application process for Business Services is complete, the Small Business Advisor will advocate on behalf of the entrepreneur to ensure the best possible course of action for the entrepreneur to achieve their goals. Following the planning stage, an introductory meeting is scheduled between the entrepreneur, ProsperUS, and the service provider to discuss collaboration and scope of service. _ProsperUS Detroit greatly reduces the cost of services to the entrepreneur based on the type of business or personal income._
