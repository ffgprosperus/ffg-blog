Our Business Services program offers proven and professional services to neighborhood small businesses. These services build capacity for entrepreneurs and are high-quality, low-cost opportunities for growth.

The Business Services Program allows entrepreneurs to work in partnership with an awarded service provider and ProsperUS by reducing time and cost of key services. Those services are approved in an amount of hours determined by the [Small Business Advisor](http://localhost:1313/prosperus-staff/), Business Services Committee, and the selected Service Provider. Our team works with a variety of service providers with a range of skills, expertise, and areas of focus.
