![What We Do - ProsperUS Detroit](http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Trainers.png)


ProsperUS Detroit is a place-based economic development strategy designed to empower low and moderate income, immigrant and minority individuals. Through place-based, culturally competent services, we strive to support the entrepreneurial spirit and small business community that exists in Detroit’s neighborhoods. We work to make an impact through [Entrepreneur Training](http://localhost:1313/entrepreneur-training/), [Business Services](http://localhost:1313/business-services/), and [Micro-Lending](http://localhost:1313/micro-lending/). We hope to develop long-term relationships with Community Partners and entrepreneurs that will develop neighborhood leaders bolstering economic growth.
