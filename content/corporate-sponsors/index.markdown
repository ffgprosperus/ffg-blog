![Funders - ProsperUS Detroit](http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Funders.png)


ProsperUS Detroit is committed to collaboration as a tool of economic development for working with small businesses and entrepreneurs. Right now, we are developing packages to provide opportunities for corporations and established businesses to support entrepreneurs in our program. In the meantime, we are open to contributions and enthusiastic support from the community.


## Examples of Ways to Help


**MONEY**
No matter what your company’s philanthropic budget is, you can make a difference. Below are the sponsorship levels:

$1,000 - Buy dinner for each of the training sessions

_Our aspiring business owners come to the sessions after busy days with their jobs and families. While ProsperUS cannot provide the participants with food for 11 sessions, adding dinner would go a long way in improving participant morale._

$5,000 – Help with marketing the program to communities

_Many aspiring small business owners do not know about the opportunity ProsperUS presents to them. With your contribution, we can run a proper marketing campaign, which will reach more people and change more lives._

$10,000 – Sponsor a cohort for 11-week training

_An 11-week training course costs $10,000. Your sponsorship will help transform individuals with aspirations but little wherewithal, into people with the skills and tools needed to implement their business vision._

$25,000 – Sponsor a participant’s small business loan

_An individual who graduates our program qualifies for $25,000 in loans towards the startup costs of a new business. Your company can handpick a participant, and track their business’s progress. Your contribution will be given to ProsperUS, which will then supply the individual with the loan._

**IN-KIND DONATIONS**

As the participants start their business, they have the need for stationary, computers, phones, office furniture, and the like. ProsperUS will store your donation, notify all participants and distribute the supplies.

**TIME**
If your company prefers a more hands-on connection to your nonprofit partners, we offer a range of ways you can donate your time and expertise:

Tier 1: Guest Lecture
_Donate your company’s employees for guest lectures during the training course. The topics would range from Internet Marketing to Operations Management._
Time Commitment: 4 Hours

Tier 2: Help ProsperUS Increase its Capacity
_ProsperUS is always looking to expand and improve. To that end, we are searching for professional help in program evaluation and analysis. In helping ProsperUS, your company ensures that people in underserved areas of Detroit continue to get trained in starting their own businesses._
Time Commitment: 10 Hours

Tier 3: Provide Professional Services
_Provide professional services in legal advice, marketing, finance, operations, and workforce development to participants who have graduated from the training program._
Time Commitment: 14 Hours (no more than 2 hours a week)

Tier 4: Support and Mentor a New Business Owner
_As ProsperUS participants start implementing their business plans they will need guidance and support from an experienced professional. Your company can lend an ear to these new business owners and give them some general guidance about their business’s direction._
Time Commitment: 1 hour meetings every two weeks for 1 year (26 hours)


## How to Join US


All aspects of our program are eager to work with volunteers and corporate sponsors that seek ways to connect with Detroit’s neighborhood businesses and promote place-based economic development. If your business is interested in working with low and moderate income, immigrant and minority entrepreneurs and small business owners, we welcome your enthusiasm to help grow our program and offer essential resources to the community.
