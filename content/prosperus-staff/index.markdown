After enrolling at the University of Michigan to pursue Art and Design, Mackenzie discovered her passion for social justice—finding she not only wanted her art to address social issues but also to work to change them. This shift led her to dual major in Sociology, with a Law, Justice, and Social Change sub-major. She was inspired to study abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark, to learn about human trafficking.

In her time at U of M, Mackenzie has collaborated with Detroit high school students, creating a footwear brand that aimed to transition the students from consumers to creators. Mackenzie has led an art workshop with inmates at a county jail to support a traditionally outcasted population. She will be continuing to collaborate with this community in her senior year, along with leading the Women's Ice Hockey Team as a co-captain.

As an intern at ProsperUS, Mackenzie is eager to learn more about non-profit work and to continue to engage with the Detroit community.
